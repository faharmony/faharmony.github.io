/**
 * State
 * ---
 *
 * This directory contains module state.
 * Harmony uses the Redux-Toolkit setup and
 * treats each Module as a Slice.
 *
 * Use other files like `store.ts` and `reducers.ts`
 * to maintain the functionality of ModuleState.
 * This file is responsible for combining them.
 *
 * There is no need for separately creating or
 * maintaining `actions` as they are generated
 * using slice's case reducers.
 *
 * @readonly No edit required in this file unless
 * ModuleId changes.
