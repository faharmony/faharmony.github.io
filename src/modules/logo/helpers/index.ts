/**
 * Helpers
 * ---
 *
 * This directory contains reusable helpers.
 * A helper could be utility functions, type definitions,
 * or anything else that might assist in development.
 *
 * If a helper is useful or essential for multiple
 * modules or applications, then it should be moved
 * to Harmony.
 *
 * The best practice is to move helper to a file
 * representing its type, so similar helpers are together.
 *
 * 4 such files are provided:
 * utilities.ts, triggers.ts, types.ts
