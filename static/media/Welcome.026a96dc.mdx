### Introduction

---

Harmony is build to standardize the react-based app development at FA Solutions.

Harmony is split in to multiple smaller and focused libraries. Each library provides a specific set of exports which can be used in app development. The sub-libraries are:

- `@harmony/core`

  - All basic components, theme, and utilities

- `@harmony/template`

  - App renderer, keycloak auth, Views (Page, Summary, ...) and FABar
    (global bar)

- `@harmony/navigation`

  - App menu, and other navigation (in future)

- `@harmony/table`

  - Table component

- `@harmony/charts`

  - Highcharts components (line, pie, ..., stock, map, ...)

- `@harmony/form`

  - Form components (input, date-picker, ...) and utilities

- `@harmony/module`
  - library to maintain module generator script

This documentation will deal with all the mentioned packages/libraries.
`@faharmony/core` is the base library. All other libraries are dependent on it.

> PS: This app is also build using Harmony.
