### Setup

---

Harmony's packages are privately hosted on GitHub's
private package repository and can be fetched with proper authentication.
All FA applications build using [`fa-react-app`](https://bitbucket.org/fasolutions-ondemand/fa-react-app/)
boilerplate already contains the proper setup to get Harmony working.

To make sure that the setup is correctly done, check the
`.npmrc` file in the root of the project. It should contain
following lines with actual AUTH-TOKENs.

    # .npmrc

    # Public NPM registry
    registry = "https://registry.npmjs.com/"

    # Private FortAwesome registry for FontAwesome pro icons
    @fortawesome:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
    //npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken=AUTH_TOKEN

    # Private GitHub registry for FA Harmony
    @faharmony:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
    //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=AUTH_TOKEN

### Install

---

Once the setup is complete, all is left to install the Harmony package.
You can install one package at a time as per your need or install all
together and then decide which to use and keep.

    # Stable release

    # Important libraries
    npm install @faharmony/core @faharmony/navigation @faharmony/template

    # Feature libraries (optional)
    npm install @faharmony/form @faharmony/table @faharmony/charts

    # Development libraries
    npm install -D @faharmony/module

There is always a SNAPSHOT (in-development) version of Harmony. It can
be installed using @SNAPSHOT tag.

> WARNING: An app should never be released with SNAPSHOT version of Harmony.

    # Snapshot (non-stable) release

    # Important libraries
    npm install @faharmony/core@SNAPSHOT @faharmony/navigation@SNAPSHOT @faharmony/template@SNAPSHOT

    # Feature libraries (optional)

Harmony isn't standalone library. It is dependent on other 3rd party
libraries. These needs to be installed as well. Following libraries are
required for the basic app to work:
