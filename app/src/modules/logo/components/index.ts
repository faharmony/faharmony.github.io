/**
 * Components

 * This directory contains reusable components which
 * are used by either Pages or other Components.
 *
 * If a component is useful or essential for multiple
 * modules or applications, then it should be moved
 * to Harmony.
 *
 * To begin, create a Component file/folder in this
 * directory and export it from this file.
 *
 * A sample component is provided for quick start.
 * It should be removed along with its references.
